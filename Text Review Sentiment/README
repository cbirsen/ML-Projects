Name of the project: Text Review Sentiment

Summary: This project contains two models trying to solve the same problem of categorizing the sentiment 
behind text reviews from Amazon, Yelp, and IMdB. Both models use a Bag of Words approach where reviews
are vectorized with CountVectorizer in one of the models and with TfidfVectorizer in the other model.
The model using CountVectorizer uses logistic regression to make the predictions while the model using 
TfidfVectorizer uses random forest method to make predictions.
